# Classifying Galaxies with CNNs

This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly the VGG16 model, to automate the classification of galaxies into spirals and ellipticals. With the influx of data from advanced telescopes like JWST and E-ELT, efficient classification of these celestial objects becomes crucial. By fine-tuning the VGG16 model and employing systematic hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, this project enhances the accuracy of galaxy classification, offering new insights into the diverse structures of galaxies in the universe.
